# Brick-Breaker-Game
"Brick Breaker" is a timeless arcade game where players control a paddle to deflect a bouncing ball, smashing rows of bricks above. As the ball rebounds off the paddle, players strategically aim to clear the bricks while preventing the ball from falling past the paddle. The game features multiple levels with increasingly challenging brick formations and faster ball speeds, keeping players engaged and challenged. Developed using Java programming language, the game employs Java Swing for its graphical user interface, enabling intuitive controls and immersive gameplay experience. Object-oriented programming principles are incorporated for modular design and code reusability, ensuring maintainability and scalability of the game. Additionally, procedural generation algorithms dynamically generate unique brick layouts for each level, enhancing replayability and variety.
